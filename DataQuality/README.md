#Data quality

This is an informatics study that focuses on data quality (rather than a clinical question).

#Use of output data
We plan to compare several sites on how they use Achilles, however the final manuscript or any of its apendices will not expose publically any details about any given site.

If you share your site's data with the DataQuality study principal investigator or the study team, it will be only for the purpose of comparison. All compared sites will be refered to under meaningless site ID. All results will be pooled together so that any site or dataset will be hidden in a crowd of several sites/datasets.

This principle was used in the initial study of Achilles Heel output. (precursor to this study)

If any site requires a formal Data Use Agreement between the your site and the Data Quality Study Principal Investigator, please indicate so. 

#Iterative development

We plan to arrive at thresholds for some data quality measures. (e.g., average number of patients per provider). We hope to execute number of new measures at different sites (claims data, EHR data) to arrive at thresholds values that could be used in data quality rules/checks. We may need multiple iterations to arrive at such thresholds (and tweaks to the measure computations) as we explore more sites.
