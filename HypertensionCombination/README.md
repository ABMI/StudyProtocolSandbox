#Comparison of combination treatment in hypertension

The goal of antihypertensive therapy is to reduce cardiovascular end points including stroke, myocardial infarction, and heart failure by lowering blood pressure. Although it is evident that BP reduction per se is the primary determinant of CV risk reduction, the choice of initial drug therapy can exert some effect on long-term outcomes. Many large randomized trials have shown that two or more antihypertensive agents are required for reaching their treatment goals. Furthermore, recent data have suggested that the use of combination therapy in patients with hypertension may be beneficial for blood-pressure-lowering efficacy, obtaining blood pressure goals earlier, and reducing major adverse cardiovascular events. To date, However, the best combination treatment in hypertension have not been demonstrated. The evidence through OHDSI network can help clinicians to select the combination treatment for their patients.
